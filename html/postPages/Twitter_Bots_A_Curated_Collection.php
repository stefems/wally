<h2>The Joy of Bot Ross</h2>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Happy Little Painting 179717576-9 <a href="https://t.co/pip1kXTKsz">pic.twitter.com/pip1kXTKsz</a></p>&mdash; Bot Ross (@JoyOfBotRoss) <a href="https://twitter.com/JoyOfBotRoss/status/827970157708316672">February 4, 2017</a></blockquote>

<p>Bot Ross? Bot Ross. Automated ASMR inbound! The <a href="https://twitter.com/JoyOfBotRoss">@joyofbotross</a> creates "an endless stream of dithered paintings" inspired by Bob Ross. This kind of art is known as "generative" or "procedural" art because the programmer creates a set of rules and includes a degree of randomization (or "noise") to ensure that when the rules are carried out the result will be unique. It's pretty rad. If you're not an artist you can always let the computer take over — it's not that easy, erm, but anyway, that's not the point.

<h2>Great Art Bot</h2>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="und" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/zVvdNVd77u">pic.twitter.com/zVvdNVd77u</a></p>&mdash; Great Artist (@greatartbot) <a href="https://twitter.com/greatartbot/status/829464863483125760">February 8, 2017</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>While we're on the generative art kick we might as well look at <a href="https://twitter.com/greatartbot">@greatartbot</a>, a self-assured little bot that creates random art pieces. The art might be up your alley if you have an affinity for pixel art and grew up watching those distorted TV channels that weren't included in your cable subscription. Yup, we knew you were one of those types. Discovered via <a href="http://nymag.com/selectall/2015/11/12-weirdest-funniest-smartest-twitter-bots.html">nymag</a>.</p>

<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Do you need advice? If so, the <a href="https://twitter.com/nice_tips_bot">@nice_tips_bot</a> has you covered, and by "covered we mean covered with the kind of advice that doesn't make sense and is probably kind of <i>lousy</i> but, hey, that's part of the draw. This bot takes text scraped from WikiHow answers. What other goldmines exist for mining? (Yahoo answers, we're looking at you.)

<h2>Medieval Death Bot</h2>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Alfred of Ravensden went after dinner to sow his land, where he had the falling sickness and suddenly died by misadventure</p>&mdash; Medieval Death Bot (@DeathMedieval) <a href="https://twitter.com/DeathMedieval/status/835629217882632192">February 25, 2017</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Bots can be chatty. And, well, bots can be a bit morose. Sometimes bots get caught up in a conversation with other bots, and we mention the <a href="https://twitter.com/DeathMedieval">@deathmedieval</a> bot because it <a href="https://theamericangenius.com/social-media/two-twitter-bots-battle/">famously</a> had a 500+ message exchange with the <a href="https://twitter.com/nice_tips_bot">@nice_tips_bot</a>. Pleasant advice and causes of death written by medieval coroners (that's what the medieval bot tweeets, yup) were exchanged, over, and over, and over.

<h2>THIS SUMMER Bot</h2>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">In a theater near you in 2016! <a href="https://t.co/1L7t3h2nfL">pic.twitter.com/1L7t3h2nfL</a></p>&mdash; This Summer Bot (@ThisSummerBot) <a href="https://twitter.com/ThisSummerBot/status/832041604990935040">February 16, 2017</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>The <a href="https://twitter.com/thissummerbot">@thissummerbot</a> takes title cards from movie trailers and somehow mashes them together to create new, bizarre trailers for movies. It's astounding that the creators were able to systematically extract the text from the trailers, and that they were able to to pair the pieces into legible sentences. This bot was made by the veteran bot maker <a href="https://twitter.com/tinysubversions">Darius Kazemi</a> with help from video editor <a href="https://twitter.com/dunkr">Duncan Robson</a>. We'll mention Darius's work often, and check out his <a href="http://tinysubversions.com/">site</a> to see his bot projects.</p>

<h2>Moth Generator Bot</h2>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="und" dir="ltr">army<br>neoblitroma quadralynx <a href="https://t.co/6rIxCTnhLG">pic.twitter.com/6rIxCTnhLG</a></p>&mdash; moth generator (@mothgenerator) <a href="https://twitter.com/mothgenerator/status/834849981152505860">February 23, 2017</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Do you like moths? You probably don't, and that's totally cool, but you're about to discover that moths (or fake moths randomly generated from text?) are actually super, super cool. "When someone tweets <a href="https://twitter.com/mothgenerator">@mothgenerator</a>, the bot uses the text of that tweet to seed the drawing. The language is translated into a number, on which all of the moth components are based. For example, if you were to tweet your name at it, it would reply with a moth unique to your name and unlike any other moth that it had ever made."

<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Would you like randomly created, tiny star fields? Sometimes gazing up at the real-world stars can be overwhelming. The <a href="https://twitter.com/tiny_star_field">@tiny_star_field</a> bot condenses them into this nice little form, and it's quaint and relaxing. Created by <a href="https://twitter.com/katierosepipkin">Katie Rose Pipkin</a>, just as is the previous bot. Check out her other work <a href="http://katierosepipkin.com/">here</a>. I'm a big fan of her bots.</p>

<h2>Botgle</h2>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Warning! Just 3 minutes left<br>Ｎ　Ｔ　Ｙ　Ｂ　<br>Ｉ　Ｔ　Ｔ　Ｎ　<br>Ｐ　Ｃ　Ｅ　Ｔ　<br>Ｎ　Ｈ　Ｍ　Ｒ　<br><br>🏆</p>&mdash; BoggleBot (@Botgle) <a href="https://twitter.com/Botgle/status/836593247329869824">February 28, 2017</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Do you know what Boggle is? It's a game, and I'm not particularly sure how it's played, but the cool thing is that the game can be played on Twitter <i>through</i> the <a href="https://twitter.com/Botgle">@botgle</a> bot. Yeah.</p>

<h2>Portmanteau Bot</h2>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">sextonight</p>&mdash; portmanteau_bot (@portmanteau_bot) <a href="https://twitter.com/portmanteau_bot/status/457209084635119616">April 18, 2014</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>A portmanteau is a combination of words with a combined meaning, like the word "brunch." The <a href="https://twitter.com/portmanteau_bot">@portmanteau_bot</a> creates new words, like a combination of sexton and tonight. The stars must have aligned for that portmanteau, and for once, all was good in the world.</p>

<h2>Stop and Frisk Bot</h2>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">04/08/11: Police stop a 32-year-old in Brooklyn, citing &quot;furtive movements.&quot; No weapon is found.</p>&mdash; Stop and Frisk (@stopandfrisk) <a href="https://twitter.com/stopandfrisk/status/836656702124589057">February 28, 2017</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Twitter is one of the best ways to spread information, and not all of this information is for entertainment. The <a href="https://twitter.com/stopandfrisk">@stopandfrisk</a> bot keeps track of stop and frisk actions of the NYPD, humanizing the people involved, and revealing that the underlying reasons for stop and frisk activities might be classist and/or racist. Yeah, it's a kickass bot. We're going to share a few more journalistic and commentary-style bots. Be sure to check out the full <a href="http://mashable.com/2013/06/25/twitter-stop-and-frisk/#M_s8ObLlIsqw">article</a> about the bot, discovered via an excellent survey of similar bots via <a href="https://points.datasociety.net/a-brief-survey-of-journalistic-twitter-bot-projects-109204a8d585#.k66t6zot9">Points</a>.</p>

<h2>NSA Prism Bot</h2>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Amelia Cronin of Garryfield, Indiana uploaded a video called EDIBLES!!! to Facebook.</p>&mdash; NSA PRISM (@NSA_PRISMbot) <a href="https://twitter.com/NSA_PRISMbot/status/768411285302239232">August 24, 2016</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>While the tweets created by the <a href="https://twitter.com/NSA_PRISMbot">@NSA_PRISMbot</a> are not made from real data, it goes without saying that this puts surveillance systems in a certain light. The bot is no longer active, but it's one of my favorites. Also discovered via <a href="https://points.datasociety.net/a-brief-survey-of-journalistic-twitter-bot-projects-109204a8d585#.k66t6zot9">Points</a>.</p>

<h2>Census Americans Bot</h2>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I speak German  at home. I live with my parents, my father works. I moved last year. Both of my parents are from here, we live together.</p>&mdash; censusAmericans (@censusAmericans) <a href="https://twitter.com/censusAmericans/status/836531397410099201">February 28, 2017</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>The <a href="https://twitter.com/censusamericans">@censusAmericans</a> bot, on the other hand, actually does use real data. It creates small vignettes of people from census data. There are no names, but it's an interesting experience seeing individuals condensed into a single tweet that mentions their work, their language, or their marriage status. Discovered via <a href="https://points.datasociety.net/a-brief-survey-of-journalistic-twitter-bot-projects-109204a8d585#.k66t6zot9">Points</a>.</p>

<h2>Video Surveillance Bot</h2>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="in" dir="ltr">ＢＡＩ▅▟ＴＨ▅ＴＩＧ <a href="https://t.co/vZnhBF1BPe">pic.twitter.com/vZnhBF1BPe</a></p>&mdash; ˇÿˇ€ (@FFD8FFDB) <a href="https://twitter.com/FFD8FFDB/status/839536446172184576">March 8, 2017</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Cameras, CCTV, surveillance; when does something created to protect people begin to infringe on peoples' rights? That's not a a question I have an answer for. The <a href="https://twitter.com/FFD8FFDB">@FFD8FFDB</a> bot taps into unsecured cameras connected to the internet and takes images from their feeds. The creator has made sure that images never show faces, and usually the images are just of objects. I'm not sure why, but I never get tired of these images appearing on my feed. It's currently my favorite bot, perhaps for the distorted aesthetic, but also because of how eerie the images are and the subtext they cast about surveillance. Other bots humanize people, but this one gives us a perspective that does quite the opposite. Please read this excellent <a href="https://medium.com/@derekarnold/remote-viewing-5cb161cdef4a#b5ef.vem7tmr39">write-up</a> by the creator.</p>

<h2>Think Piece Bot</h2>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">What Twilight Can Teach Us About Putin</p>&mdash; Thinkpiece Bot 🌹 (@thinkpiecebot) <a href="https://twitter.com/thinkpiecebot/status/839041134433300480">March 7, 2017</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>We need some humor. <a href="https://twitter.com/thinkpiecebot">@thinkpiecebot</a> has us covered. If you're a fan of ludicrous news headlines, this might be your next favorite thing.

<h2>A Teenage Girl Bot</h2>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">am now convinced my parents are totally just insecure</p>&mdash; olivia taters (@oliviataters) <a href="https://twitter.com/oliviataters/status/838900086939791365">March 6, 2017</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>One of the most popular bots is probably <a href="https://twitter.com/oliviataters">@oliviataters</a>. The bot emulates a stereotypical American teenage girl (stereotypes aren't cool, we agree, but this bot is still something to behold.) There's an entire On The Media <a href="http://www.wnyc.org/story/29-olivia-taters-robot-teenager/">article</a> about her, and there was also a time when she engaged in a conversation with two other bots. Check out the Atlantic <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/07/that-time-2-bots-were-talking-and-bank-of-america-butted-in/374023/">article</a> that breaks it down.</p>

<h2>Reverse OCR bot</h2>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="in" dir="ltr">ceramics <a href="https://t.co/euskSVtSoX">pic.twitter.com/euskSVtSoX</a></p>&mdash; Reverse OCR (@reverseocr) <a href="https://twitter.com/reverseocr/status/838631547901198336">March 6, 2017</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>The <a href="https://twitter.com/reverseocr">@reverseocr</a> bot randomly chooses a word and draws randomly until word recognition software thinks that the word was made. My favorite part about this bot is that it's believable that the software is working when you see the word first and then the drawing, but if you look at the drawing and try to guess the word it's virtually impossible. (Darius Kazemi made this one.)</p>

<h2>God Tributes Bot</h2>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">MAMAS FOR THE MAMA GOD! PAPAS FOR THE PAPA FIEND</p>&mdash; Appropriate Tributes (@godtributes) <a href="https://twitter.com/godtributes/status/839460723923304449">March 8, 2017</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Does your god need a tribute? The answer to that question is 'yes.' All of the other gods need tributes too so the <a href="https://twitter.com/godtributes">@godtributes</a> bots has set out to do just that. I like this bot a lot. Maybe it's the caps? The zeal? The fervor? Ah, I'll just stop there.</p>

<h2>Glitched Logos Bot</h2>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="und" dir="ltr">p͜l̵a͞y͏st̵atío͟o̷n̛™ <a href="https://t.co/Fbe0W9aj2U">pic.twitter.com/Fbe0W9aj2U</a></p>&mdash; Glitch Logos (@GlitchLogos) <a href="https://twitter.com/GlitchLogos/status/838671758597185537">March 6, 2017</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>The <a href="https://twitter.com/GlitchLogos">@GlitchLogos</a> bot seems banal at first, but take a look through the glitched logos, and if you're like me, you'll begin to feel something strange yet pleasant. Logos are supposed to be these perfect symbols for brands and corporations, and when they're broken down like this I get a strange satisfaction, almost as if I'm reveling in the disorder and chaos beset upon these representations that dominate our psyche. Okay, so that rant was certainly a bit pseudo-intellectual, but who doesn't get a kick out of seeing a fucked-up Starbucks logo? Advertisements are tiring, you know?</p>

<h2>Feelings bot</h2>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">at the moment i feel kind of like a continuation</p>&mdash; ✧ ➳ feelings.js ✧ (@feelings_js) <a href="https://twitter.com/feelings_js/status/839403323505717249">March 8, 2017</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>How are you feeling, reader? I'm feeling very okay. Sometimes I feel aggressively mediocre, or just fine, and I'll say it with a certain disdain, of course. Sometimes I just say "peachy" with a certain ambiguous enthusiasm and it usually goes well. Well, anyway, our feelings are important, and so are the <a href="https://twitter.com/feelings_js">@feelings_js</a> bot's too. Made by Katie Rose Pipkin.</p>

<h2>Strange Anti-Capitalist Poet Bot</h2>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Welcome to lens prison and confine within the computational regime involve, in the kitchen like an art deco ziggurat.</p>&mdash; MEDDLING HETERO FOOL (@direlog_ebooks) <a href="https://twitter.com/direlog_ebooks/status/759365436697894912">July 30, 2016</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>I can't really pin down the <a href="https://twitter.com/direlog_ebooks">@direlog_ebooks</a> bot. I mention it mostly because this <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/i-had-a-crush-on-a-twitter-bot">person</a> pretty much fell in love with it. This isn't as uncommon as you'd think, either. There's a great RadioLab <a href="http://www.radiolab.org/story/137407-talking-to-machines/">episode</a> in which someone falls in love with a chatbot.</p>

<p>Phew. That's it.</p>

<p>So, bots are neat and artsy and communicative, but it's worth closing with a note that bots are everywhere, especially in places you don't realize. This <a href="http://truthy.indiana.edu/botornot/">resource</a> can be used to determine if a twitter account is likely to be a bot, and there's a lot of <a href="https://www.crummy.com/2013/11/27/0">conversations</a> about ethics and bots. Bots were heavily used in the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2016/10/19/one-in-four-debate-tweets-comes-from-a-bot-heres-how-to-spot-them/">US election</a>, retweeting candidates and getting <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/11/election-bots/506072/">involved</a> in conversations. Bots have also been involved in Brexit, Russia, and are being used all over the world. There's bots for Slack, <a href="https://x.ai/">personal assistant</a> bots, and more. What will become of chatbots, twitter bots, and other bots that take advantage or undermine social media or dating sites? How will bots modify how we do work and interact with the world around us? If you're interested in learning more about bots, head over to botmakers.org to sign up to join the slack group. Trawl twitter for tags with #botALLY too.</p>
