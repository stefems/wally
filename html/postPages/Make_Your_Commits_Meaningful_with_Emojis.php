		<p>Everyone loves to harp on worthless commit messages. Read and weep, my friends:</p>

		It’s like waking up in the morning and discovering that your roommate rearranged everything in the kitchen. Your roommate, bless their heart, was wasted last night and for some reason moved EVERYTHING into different cabinets because "reasons". They tell you that it was for the best, but can’t tell you where the bowls are located. You need your cereal, goddamit, and oh, great, we can’t find the coffee mugs either — WE’RE ALL GONNA DIE.
		</p>
		<p>
		Commit messages are tricky. They’re boring. They’re tedious. To spice things up, some have even gone to great lengths to make the commit messages <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Buc8yzHCYAAQpXy.jpg">interesting</a> with click-bait-esque titles, and by interesting we mean funny for, hmmm,  maybe two commits. Surely there’s another approach, right?
		</p>
		<p>
		Emojis are the answer. Well, maybe not for this metaphor, but for commit messages. Yes, emojis. You know them as the strange little images your mom and pops use incorrectly. Sometimes prospective significant others send them to you, but it’s usually a bit awkward because you’re not really on the same page with their emoji-ing, or better yet, your crappy flip phone (you filthy hipster) only renders emojis as squares so you’ve just got to read their damn mind and hope for the best. Well, anyway, I got a tip from a fellow developer who told me that their team made a legend to map emojis to meaningful commit actions. Here are some examples:</p>
		<p><span class="emoji">🚀</span>when improving performance</p>
		<p><span class="emoji">🐛</span>when squashing/reporting bugs</p>
		<p><span class="emoji">🔒</span>when working on security</p>
		<p><span class="emoji">💄</span>when developing UI</p>
		<p><span class="emoji">➕</span>when adding a feature</p>
		<p><span class="emoji">➖</span>when removing a feature</p>
		
		<p>
		Maybe you can pair emojis for extra meanings too. A bug combined with security. A rocket and lipstick for UI, or a mobile phone with a plus sign. You can use a triangular flag 🚩 for problematic code you’ve found, (or something stinky 💩 for code smells), or a shower-head  💦 for when your commit has taken care of some needed code cleanup. Hit this <a href="https://medium.com/r/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.webpagefx.com%2Ftools%2Femoji-cheat-sheet%2F">link</a> to see the emojis that are supported by Github and other platforms. Hit this <a href="https://gist.github.com/AliMD/3344523">link</a> if you’d just like to see the emojis supported by Github. If you’re confused as how to get the ":emojiNameGoesHere:" for the emoji, open the developer console or load the page via the “raw” button.

		Commit messages can be misleading or unhelpful, and when they are informative they’re sometimes too lengthy and difficult to read and get the gist of quickly. Use emojis to clean things up, and hey, it might make things a bit funny too.
